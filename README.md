# gRPC error handling and JUnit tests example

This is an example on how to handle gRPC errors and how to write JUnit 5 integration tests.  

This example is composed by three modules:
- [contract](contract/) - protocol buffers definition
- [server](server/) - implementation of service
- [client](client/) - invocation of service

See the README for each module.  
Start at contract, then go to server, and finally go to the client.
